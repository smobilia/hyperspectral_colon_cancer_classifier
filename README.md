# Classification of Hyperspectral Colon Cancer Images Using CNNs README file

## Project Summary
The purpose of this project was to show how hyperspectral imagery can be used to detect cancerous colon tissue samples.

## Requirements
The hyperspectral images were compiled using a Python environment running Python version 3.4.5 and the gdal package version 2.1.0.

To relabel the images, the os, imageio, numpy, and matplotlib packages are required.

To convert the images into hdf5 files, the h5py, imagio, numpy, pandas, os, datetime, collections, and random packages are required.

To run the CNN, the os, tensorflow 1.9, numpy, pandas, imageio, h5py, datetime, random, functools, matplotlib, random, and sklearn packages are required.
